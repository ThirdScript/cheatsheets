cheatsheets still alive !
===========
This repository contains community-sourced cheatsheets to be used with
[cheat][] and similar applications.
the old repository is not maintained anymore, I am working on this myself
and I would be very happy if anyone wanted to contribute

### How to use this ? ###
> cheat -d
```sh
community: /home/sepehr/snap/cheat/common/.config/cheat/cheatsheets/community
personal:  /home/sepehr/snap/cheat/common/.config/cheat/cheatsheets/personal
```
go to either the community or personal folder and add this repository as your remote

#### To change community repo to this
```sh
cd /home/sepehr/snap/cheat/common/.config/cheat/cheatsheets/community
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:ThirdScript/mycheats.git
```

### Format ###
Cheatsheets are plain-text files that begin with an optional "front matter"
header in YAML format. The header may be used to assign "tags" to a sheet, and
to specify the sheet's syntax (`bash`, `python`, `go`, etc).

When possible, cheatsheets should conform to this format:

```sh
---
syntax: bash
tags: [ vcs, development ]
---
# To stage all changes in the current directory:
git add --all

# To commit staged changes:
git commit -m <message>
```

As a guideline, it is preferred to use [docopt][] syntax when specifying
parameter placeholders. In edge-cases where that syntax may cause confusion, it
is permissible to use placeholder values (`foo.txt`, `example.com`, etc.) as
necessary.
